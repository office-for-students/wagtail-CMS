# Getting Started

## First time here?

The docker image for this branch is created differently from the other branches (`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0` is now run inside the image, not as a command on the image in the `docker-compose.yml`). This means that the old containers and images for other branches need to be deleted so the new one can be built.

```
$ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID     IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                  PORTS       NAMES
<container_id>   wagtail-cms_web     "python manage.py ruâ€¦"   3 days ago     Exited (0) 3 days ago               wagtail-cms_web_1
............     .....               "...................."   ..........     .............           27017/tcp   .................
$ docker rmi -f <container_id>
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                            TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
wagtail-cms_web                       latest       <image_id>     11 days ago     1.07GB
...............                       latest       ............   3 weeks ago     ......
$ docker rm <image_id>
...
```

This now means when you run `docker-compose up` docker will rebuild the image using the new commands in the `Dockerfile`, and then build a new container from that

> *REMEMBER:* To run the commands above when switching back to the other branches on the project

## Tests

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py test
```

> *IMPORTANT:* When fixing an issue write a test first to prove it's broken. Then, and only then, fix the problem

## Configure

### Secret Key

```
$ python3
>>> import secrets
>>> chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)'
>>> ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for i in range(50))
<secret_key>
>>> exit()
$ vim docker-compose.yml
...
SECRET_KEY: "<secret_key>"
...
```

### Defaults

```
$ cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
$ vim docker-compose.yml
...
DBHOST:               "db"
DBNAME:               "django"
DBUSER:               "docker"
DBPASSWORD:           "docker"
...

...
MONGODB_HOST:         "mongo"
MONGODB_USERNAME:     "mongodb"
MONGODB_PASSWORD:     "mongodb"
...
SEARCHAPIHOST:        "..."
...
$ docker-compose up
```

> If docker fails to start up because the `SECRET_KEY`, re-create the secret key and try again. Sometime it fails because of the use of irregular or un-escapped characters.

> If this is the first time working on the code base remember to populate [PostgreSQL](#database) and [MongoDB](#mongodb)

> If you are going to be importing new data to the fixtures remember to set DATASETAPIHOST, DATASETAPIKEY, AZURECOSMOSDBURI and AZURECOSMOSDBKEY

## Docker

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed to be able to see changes in the code, run tests and update local data.

```
$ docker-compose up
```

> Make sure to run this command in a separate window so you have somewhere to run other commands from

> This command will download all the required images (Python, PostgreSQL, CosmosDB) and start them for you all preconfigured

# Database

## Populating

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_cms
```

This will run the command `content/management/commands/populate_cms.py`. This command loads the data found at `CMS/fixtures/postgres.json` into the database.

You might ask why you can't use Django and to run `... python manage.py loaddata CMS/fixtures/postgres.json`. The foreign key constraints in Wagtail prevent this. When trying to run `loaddata` Django will fail in deleting (truncating) the old data. The `populate_cms` command gets round this by calling a custom flush command (`content/management/commands/flush_db.py`) that exposes the `--allow-cascade` flag on Django's own flush command. In additional it deletes a number of default posts and content types that are created when migrations are run and prevent the `postgres.json` file from being inserted into the database.

### Updating Postgres Data *(CMS/fixtures/postgres.json)*

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py update_cms_fixture --db_host ... --db_name ... --db_user ... --db_password ... --db_port ...
```

> Use the creds for the remote PostgreSQL in the above statement

Want to make sure the command above is not in your command history for people to find on your machine? Then do the following.

```
$ set +o history
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_cms ...
$ set -o history
```

Already in your command history but want to delete it?

```
$ history | tail -n 5
100 ...
101 ...
102 ...  # <- You want to delete this one
103 ...
104 ...
$ history -d 103
```

### Deleting Data

Stop docker before running the following command

> You can stop docker by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the window in which it is running.

```
$ sudo rm -rf data/postgres
$ docker-compose up
```

# MongoDB

### Populating

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_institutions
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_courses
```

> `populate_courses` will get the courses in `settings.TEST_COURSES` from CosmosDB and put them in MongoDB **(as well as populate the file found in `courses/fixtures/courses.json`)**

### Updating local course data

If the course data has changed remotely and you want to update it locally then do the following:

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_courses --update
...
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_courses
...
```

> The first command goes to the CosmosDB *(as defined by `AZURECOSMOSDBURI` in `docker-compose.yml`)* and copies the courses specified in `TEST_COURSES` in `docker-comnpose.yml` to to `courses/fixtures/courses.json`. The second command gets the contents of `courses/fixtures/courses.json` and puts them in the local MongoDB instance.

Don't forget to commit the changes to the course data to the repo

```
$ git add courses/fixtures/courses.json
$ git commit -m '...'
```

### Adding More courses

```
$ vim docker-compose.yml
...
TEST_COURSES = 'U18-LAWLLB,AB35,...'
...
$ vim docker-compose.yml.example
...
TEST_COURSES = 'U18-LAWLLB,AB35,...'
...
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_courses --update
...
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_courses
...
$ git add docker-compose.yml.example
$ git add courses/fixtures/courses.json
$ git commit -m '...'
...
```

### Updating local institutions data

If the course data has changed remotely and you want to update it locally then do the following:

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_institutions --update
...
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py populate_institutions
...
```

Don't forget to commit the changes to the institutions data to the repo

```
$ git add institutions/fixtures/institutions.json
$ git commit -m '...'
```


### Deleting Data

Stop docker before running the following command

> You can stop docker by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the window in which it is running.

```
$ sudo rm -rf data/mongodb
$ docker-compose up
```

# URLs

The following URLs work in development

```
$ wget http://localhost:8000/institution-details/<any_institution>/
$ wget http://localhost:8000/admin/  # <- All wagtail pages

# Useful Commands

## Docker

### List images

```
$ docker images
```

From this list you can find the docker images you no longer need. Copy their `IMAGE ID`

### Deleting Images

```
$ docker rm <IMAGE_ID>
```

### Listing Containers

Container are based of images. This is what runs your code

```
$ docker ps --all
```

The `NAME`s you can see in the commands above. The `STATUS` tells you whether ac container is being used. If you no longer need a container copy the `CONTAINER ID`

### Deleting Containers

```
$ docker rmi -f <CONTAINER_ID>
```

### Get into a Container

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 bash
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_db_1 bash
```

### Using the Django Shell

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 python manage.py shell
```

##### Adding new dependencies

```
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 pip install ...
$ docker container exec -it wagtail-cms_web_1 pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

# Other Stuff

## Adding Environment Variables

If you add environment variable to `docker-compose.yml` don't forget to also add it to `CMS/settings/base.py`

## Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline

The continuous integration and deployment pipeline for this project is implemented using Azure DevOps pipelines.

### Continuous Integration

The continuous integration pipeline for the project is defined in yml files in the root of the project, all starting with 'azure-pipelines'.

There are 4 pipelines defined in the project.

#### CI test
_Defined in 'azure-pipelines.yml'_

This pipeline should run on every push to Github from feature, bug and refactor branches. All this pipeline does is run the tests to regression check the new code.

#### Development build
_Defined in 'dev-azure-pipelines.yml'_

This pipeline should run on every push to Github on the develop branch. This pipeline runs the tests and, if they pass, builds a docker container and pushes it to the dev container registry.

#### Pre prod build
_Defined in 'pre-prod-azure-pipelines.yml'_

This pipeline should run on every push to Github from a release branch. This pipeline runs the tests and, if they pass, builds a docker container and pushes it to the pre-prod container registry.

#### Production build

_Defined in 'prod-azure-pipelines.yml'_

This pipeline should run on every push to Github on the master branch. This pipeline runs the tests and, if they pass, builds a docker container and pushes it to the prod container registry.

### Continuous Deployment

The continuous deployment pipeline is defined through the Azure DevOps pipeline UI.

There are 3 pipelines setup for the project.

#### Development deploy

The pipeline runs when the Development CI pipeline passes, it pulls the container generated by the CI build on to the WebApp server and starts the container.

#### Pre prod deploy

The pipeline runs when the a new container is pushed to the pre-prod container registry, it pulls the container on to the WebApp server and starts the container.

#### Production deploy

The pipeline runs when the a new container is pushed to the prod container registry, it pulls the container on to the WebApp server and starts the container.

### Releases

Releases of the code are following the major/minor/patch pattern for release numbering.

#### Creating a release

New releases can be generated manually or by using the 'release' command in the bin directory.

##### Manual release process

- update the version number with in the version.txt file
- create a new branch named in the pattern 'release/v`version number`' (e.g. release/v0.0.1)
- push the branch to Github

##### Automated release process

- ensure there are no uncommitted changes in your local repository
- call the 'release' command in the bin directory, passing as a parameter either major/minor/patch.

#### Finishing a release

Once a release has been signed off and deployed to production, you need to:

- merge the release branch into master and to development.
- tag master with the release number at the point it was merged in.
- delete the release branch
